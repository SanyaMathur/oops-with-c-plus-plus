differences between class and struct are :
1.By default, all the members of the structure are public.But by default all members of the class are private.
2.The structure will automatically initialize its members. In contrast, constructors and destructors are used to initialize the class members.
3.When a structure is implemented, memory allocates on a stack. In contrast, memory is allocated on the heap in class.
4.Variables in a structure cannot be initialized during the declaration, but they can be done in a class.
5.A structure is a value type, while a class is a reference type.
